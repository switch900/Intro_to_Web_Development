<h2>Six ways to grow revenue with digitally-printed magazines</h2>
<h5>GRAPHIC ARTS MAGAZINE | January 20, 2018 | Tony Curcio
</h5>
<hr>
<img src="..//images/digitallyprintedmagzines-in.jpg" width="400" height="502" alt="digitally printed magazines">		
<p><em>Here, D. Eadward Tree, a pseudonymous magazine-industry insider who provides insights on publishing, postal issues and print media on his blog, <strong>Dead Tree Edition,</strong> examines profit-boosting ideas for magazine publishers.</em></p>

<p>Magazine publishers typically develop informal rules of thumb. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t go back to press with an issue unless you can justify printing at least 10,000 copies.</li>
<li>You have to charge overseas subscribers at least three times the domestic rate because of the additional shipping and mailing costs.</li>
<li>Never propose an insert or edition with fewer than 5,000 copies – you’ll never make enough money to cover your costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new (sort-of) technology has made many of those rules obsolete. The technology, for example, enables Cobblestone Living to thrive despite a circulation of only 540, all unpaid. It also powers Farm Journal and its 8-page advertising inserts that are customized according to each subscriber’s purchasing history. The cost of creating a special edition for just 450 prospects was low enough that one publisher gave it a shot – and generated an estimated $50,000 in incremental revenue. It’s the same technology that has enabled direct mail to grab a larger share of the print-advertising market from our industry. And that’s boosting book publishers’ profits and printed unit sales at the same time that print has become “a basket case” for magazines. Here’s a breakdown of the ways magazine publishers can use digital printing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short runs of individual sections.</strong> With today’s emphasis on targeted advertising, a B2B publication can charge an advertiser as much for a cover wrap going to 300 select subscribers, as for a full-page ad sent to all 30,000 subscribers. Digital printing has made such small print jobs economically viable. And remember that now, you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to create versions of an article or ad for each province/state or job title, renewal cover wraps for different types of subscribers, or special covers for copies to be given out at an event or to potential advertisers.</li>
<li><strong>Data-driven sections.</strong> Using information from the recipient – name, ZIP code, occupation, interests, purchase history, etc. – a cover, insert, or other section of the magazine can be customized for each reader. The personalization can be as simple as putting the recipient’s name in an article or inkjetting a brief message onto their cover. Or, it can be as complex as including census information about their neighborhood or a map showing how to get from their home to the nearest dealership. (Suggestion: If your printer produces catalogues or direct mail, ask for samples showing how it’s personalizing those pieces. Those industries are much further along the mass-customization road than publishers are). You can even serve different ads to different people on the same page. That could open the door to truly programmatic print advertising – where, for example, advertisers bid high CPMs to have their ads placed on the inside back cover of particular subscribers’ copies.</li>
<li><strong>Small print runs of entire magazines.</strong> Unless your title’s circulation is below roughly 2,000 copies, traditional offset printing still beats digital printing for efficiency. But even for large-circulation titles, being able to print copies digitally can come in handy. One consumer magazine publisher figured out that it costs about $200,000 to produce a 200-page issue with 350,000 copies using offset printing – and about eight times that amount for digital printing. But when a major advertiser needed 800 copies of an already-produced issue, with a revised version of its ad, digital printing got the nod with a total print and paper bill of $4,000. Going back to the original presses and binder that produced the issue would have cost about $10,000 – and the copies would not have gotten to the advertiser in time. It’s not unusual for a publisher to print 5,000 extra copies of an issue, but to use an average of only a few hundred of them. A corollary to Murphy’s Law says that the one time you cut back on such copies, you’ll get a request for several thousand for an advertiser, event, or newsstand agent. With digital printing, you can eliminate the waste and storage charges of “just-in-case” copies, knowing that you can always print just-in-time copies if needed. Digital printing means you don’t have to break the bank to create prototypes of new or re-designed titles. And you can produce international copies in-country rather than shipping them from halfway around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Print-on-demand.</strong> The ability to print just one copy for well under its selling price is a major reason digital printing is revolutionizing the book industry. Launching a new book no longer requires upfront investments in printing or shipping. Worldwide networks of on-demand book-printing plants have made international distribution practical for even niche books. Titles no longer go out of print – they simply shift from being printed in advance to being printed only when someone orders a copy. With no investment in inventory, magazine publishers can use the same tactic to sell back issues, ‘bookazines,’ article compilations and hardcover commemorative editions on their websites and on sites like Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>Fully customized magazines.</strong> For the vast majority of publishers, the ability to customize every page of every issue is a solution looking for a problem. It just doesn’t make business sense. Still, there may be opportunities to create subscriber copies for CEOs, opinion leaders, or elected officials containing additional information relevant to them – especially if there are advertisers wanting to target those VIPs. If you publish online newsletters, you probably have lots of click-through data on some subscribers. You could send them a complimentary collection of your print articles on the same subjects, with personalized ads custom-selected based on their interests and web browsing – as well as a subscription offer for your magazine(s).</li>
<li><strong>Non-magazines.</strong> Don’t limit your vision just to publications. Digital printing is already widely used for article reprints. Invoices and renewal notices can be personalized to boost response rates, upsell or cross-sell. And programmatic direct mail – containing offers targeted to people based on their recent online shopping habits – seems ripe for our industry.</li>

<h2>Why selling print will be the death of printing companies</h2>

<p>Do you remember vinyl? What about cassettes? I spent many happy days in my youth building up my record collection. And I enjoyed making compilation tapes too. All of this is now a distant memory. My vinyl was sold off long ago (although with many regrets). My cassettes are now more. DAT has been and gone. Even CDs are falling by the wayside in the era of the MP3. The music industry has evolved. Printers need to evolve too. Selling CMYK is no longer enough! Printers need to accept that good profit margins are now very difficult to make simply by selling ink on paper. Printers need to start selling a more involved service to clients. They need to start selling extra services that can have a higher profit margin than print. I call these value-added services.</p>

<p>Printers that change and start selling value added services will create a new type of relationship with their clients. Customers will be prepared to place work at higher margins with these suppliers. These print companies will be in better control of their profit margins. They’ll be better placed to achieve the right results that they need. Print companies that keep selling print and nothing else will fail to form good customer partnerships. They’ll simply be regarded as commodity printers and will have little control over their profit margins. And they’ll even struggle to stay in business. Here are three ways in which these services can change the way in which a buyer treats a printer.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Print companies are no longer seen as commodity suppliers.</strong> Instead, they’re seen as service providers and as business partners that help their clients achieve their business goals. They help their clients carry out their business more efficiently or more cost-effectively. These companies can also set themselves apart from the competition more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Buyers are willing to pay more for better skill sets.</strong> The type of sale changes when printers offer value-added services. Most buyers assume that a printer will offer good service and good quality. So they choose on price. However, if a printer is offering a value-added service such as data management or design, the situation changes. The buyer sees the skill levels at the printers as making a real difference. This is because they’re looking at a service where they will measure by return on investment. Before, they were thinking in terms of commodity manufacturing. Suddenly it’s a lot easier for a printer to stand out from the competition. But they do need to sell their skills better. This also changes the buyer’s purchasing process. It’s now more difficult to beat companies up on price. Price will always be an important decision in the purchasing process. However, in terms of print manufacturing, the buyer can simply compare a like-for-like specification. When looking at services, a buyer can be encouraged to consider return on investment rather than just looking at the cheapest price.</li>
<li><strong>Offering value-added services can make a real difference to a printer.</strong> So does this mean that all printers should become marketing services providers? Not at all. There are a wide range of value-added services that can be offered. Many printers will already have some in house, such as design or postal services. Marketing Services is certainly one strategy, but it’s not the only one.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, let’s focus on the magazine sector. Here’s how one printer put this strategy into practice. In the UK, one printer looked at the challenges that were facing many of its publishing clients. And the challenges lay not in print, but in how to tackle producing digital editions. So they developed their own software that allows their clients to create digital editions quite easily. It enabled publishers to make a single-file upload for both print and digital editions. This allowed sales conversations to move away from price matching. Many clients are now interested in having an easy digital solution from a print supplier. So, the lowest print price is no longer the most important factor. However, you need your own ‘action plan’ to create value-added services.</p>
<p>Here are three action points that you need to be scheduling right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your customers what challenges they face.</li>
<li>Create a service offering that addresses these specific issues.</li>
<li>Develop a new sales message that focuses on the services you offer, rather than just putting ink on paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you remember HMV (His Masters Voice)? Well, HMV Canada went into receivership in 2017. It didn’t change with the times. Printers who don’t change with the times will likely experience the same fate!</p>

<h2>Co-op Marketing Sales Technique</h2>
<h5>PRINTACTION MAGAZINE | June 29, 2015 | Peter Ebner</h5><hr>

<strong>Earn more business by reducing your prospect’s marketing cost by up to 75% while maintaining maximum margins</strong><br>

<p>Most account executives are facing the same two print sales challenges: How do I differentiate my services when my competitors are capable of supplying the same job and how can I be competitive when there is always someone willing to print the same job for less? Although co-op marketing does not apply to every print sales situation, if your prospect is a neighborhood business that is print marketing collateral then co-op marketing offers a unique solution to this print sales challenge.</p> 
<img style="float:left;" src="..//images/mailersbox800-500x281.jpg" height="500" width="281" alt="co-op marketing">
<strong>What is Co-op marketing?</strong>
<p>With summer now in swing, businesses that offer home services like lawn care, carpet cleaning, door and window sales, heating and air conditioning sales, eaves trough installers, roofers, driveway paving, kitchen and bathroom renovators, home improvement contractors and landscapers are getting ready for their summer marketing drive, which usually entails distributing fliers, brochures and door hangers throughout the local neighborhood. This need for marketing collateral presents an excellent opportunity for anyone in the printing industry to grow their sales and earnings.</p>

<p>But landing these accounts is not that easy, after all, most of them are already dealing with a printer and the vast majority – a whopping 80 percent – are happy with their existing supplier. So why should any of these companies endure the risk and inconvenience of changing suppliers?  Well the fact is that in most cases they won’t, unless:</p>

<p>You have something to offer that they can’t get from their existing supplier, 
You can show them how to get a better ROI, and your quote is very competitive.</p>

<p>Co-op marketing allows you to meet all three of these criteria. Co-op marketing simply means sharing the printing and distribution costs between two or more noncompetitive businesses.</p>


<p><strong>Co-op Marketing advantages</strong></p>

<strong>1. It lowers your prospect’s cost</strong>   
<p>For example, the lawn care service provider is ready to invest $3,000 to print and distribute a promotional flier; the roofing company is also planning to send promotional fliers to the same target market; and so is the driveway paving service and the eaves trough installers. If only two of these businesses got together to share the cost of the flier and distribution, they could reduce their marketing costs by up to 50 percent; and if all four got together their savings could be as high as 75 percent.</p> 

<p>From a print sales perspective creating a co-op marketing program allows you to differentiate your service by telling the prospect that you can reduce their marketing costs by up to 75 percent!</p>  

<strong>2. It will increase sales</strong>    
<p>For your prospect a reduction in marketing costs means much more than just saving money; it also means an increase in sales and higher profits. For example, take any business person; a real estate agent; the owner of a lawn care service or the owner of the local pizzeria, their success requires marketing. They need to tell everyone in their neighborhood about the service or product and the more often they get their message out, the higher their sales. But small business owners have a limited marketing budget, so although they’d like to advertise more, they cannot afford it. Small business owners will welcome an idea that allows them to promote their services more often for the same cost and co-op marketing provides this opportunity.</p>

<p>From a print sales perspective, creating a co-op marketing program allows you to differentiate your service by telling the prospect that you can share an idea that will increase their sales and gain market share.</p>

<strong>3. It makes your prospect’s marketing material more effective</strong>  
<p>Diversity increases readership. For example, a Healthcare Newsletter that included an article and ad from a dentist, a dermatologist, a chiropractor and a nutritionist would have a much higher readership then a newsletter that only focused on one of these topics. So while sharing the cost of printing and distributing a brochure, flier or door hanger will greatly reduce your prospect’s marketing cost, co-op marketing will also increase readership and, for the prospect, that means generating a higher response.</p>

<p>From a print sales perspective, creating a co-op marketing program means that you differentiate your service by telling the prospect that you can share an idea that will increase response and make their marketing collateral more effective.</p>

<p>While offering your prospects a co-op marketing opportunity is an extremely effective way to differentiate your services and eliminate price competition, you can maximize your sales and earnings by offering the prospect a marketing campaign instead of a single co-op distribution. For example, if you created a co-op Home Services Newsletter or Door Hanger your promotional package could include printing and distribution to 5-million homes once a month for six months.</p>

<strong>How to create a co-op marketing package </strong>
<ol>
<li>Select the product<br><br>
Any printed material can be turned into a co-op marketing program, a note pad, flier, postcard, calendar, oversized door hangers, or an 11 x 17 sheet can be turned into 4-page newsletter.<br><br></li>
   
<li>Select an area for distribution<br><br>
5,000 homes along specified postal routes, all the businesses within a target area<br><br></li>

<li>Pick a theme<br><br>
Again, there are lots of themes to choose from, primarily depending on time of year: Home improvements, real estate, food and entertainment, health and fitness, business services, etc.<br><br></li>

<li>List the different types of business that fit under your theme<br><br>
Home improvements: Carpet cleaning, door and window sale, heating and air conditioning sale, eaves trough installers, roofers, driveway paving, kitchen and bathroom renovators, home improvements contractors, landscapers, lawn care, plumbers and electricians.<br><br>

Food and entertainment: Restaurants, theatres, pubs, country clubs, caterers, wine making outlets, butchers, home delivery, bakers and even farms that sell to the public.<br><br>

Business services: Office cleaning, office supplies, office equipment, business insurance, car leasing, temp services, accounting, bookkeeping and computer services, courier, shipping.<br><br></li>

<li>Create a prospecting list<br><br>
Use the phone directory and Internet to identify all the local businesses on your list.<br><br></li> 

<li>Contact everyone on your list<br><br>
Tell them about the benefits. Offer everyone exclusivity by only including one company for each service. For example if your theme was dining you could make it exclusive by including only one Italian, one Chinese and one Mexican restaurant.<br><br></li>
